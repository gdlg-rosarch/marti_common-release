0.0.9 (2016-03-04)
------------------
* Fixes initialize_origin.py diagnostic reporting a warning that the
  origin is not automatic when it is.
* Adds transform publisher to initialize_origin.py that publishes an
  identity transform from the local_xy_frame to an anonymous unused
  frame.  In doing so, the local_xy_frame will show up
  in the /tf tree without any additional nodes running so that
  TransformManager can properly transform between /wgs84 and /map.
  This change should not interfere with any existing systems.
* Expands some of the TransformManager warnings to be more
  informative.  This is to reduce the impact of common problems that we
  run into when setting up a new environment by making it easier to
  distinguish the exact nature of the error, as well as provide
  suggestions when appropriate.
  In particular, this fixes the misleading
  "No transfomer from /wgs84 to /map" error and upgrades a warning
  about null pointers to an error.

0.0.8 (2016-01-06)
------------------
* Accounts for non-zero reference angles when calculating orientations to and from WGS84.
* Publishes origin with east orientation (0 yaw) by default.
* Supports arbitrary local_xy reference angles.
  * The reference heading is renamed to reference angle.
  * It's not recommended to set a non-zero reference angle.
  * Adds a parameter to ignore the reference heading for backwards compatibility.
* Fixes backwards compatibility issue with swri_yaml_cpp call.
