ros-indigo-swri-yaml-util (0.0.14-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Add develspace include directory to swri_yaml_util
    Otherwise, version.h is missing and the package fails to build
  * Make swri_yaml_util build out-of-source
    Fixes #411 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/marti_common/issues/411> by generating version.h in the devel space include folder instead of the source space.
    Based heavily on http://answers.ros.org/question/123221/
