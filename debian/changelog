  * Deprecate LatchedSubscriber.
    This commit adds an alternative to LatchedSubscriber and deprecates
    the LatchedSubscriber interface.  LatchedSubscriber should be replaced
    with a swri::Subscriber that is initialized with the address of a
    location to store messages.  For example, instead of:
    swri::LatchedSubscriber<my_package::MyMessage> msg_;
    ...
    msg_.initialize(nh_, "topic_name");
    ...
    ROS_INFO("msg->field = %f", msg->field);
    this becomes:
    swri::Subscriber sub_;
    my_package::MyMessageConstPtr msg_;
    ...
    sub_ = swri::SubscribeR(nh_, "topic_name", &msg_);
    ...
    ROS_INFO("msg->field = %f", msg->field).
    This change makes for a simpler and more consistent interface, and
    avoids the confusion that comes from overloading the -> operator.
  * Add timeoutParam() method to swri::Subscriber.
    This commit adds a new convenience method, timeoutParam, to
    swri::Subscriber that reads a specified parameter directly from the
    parameter server and sets it as the subscriber's timeout value.  This
    is to simplify setup code that currently has to define a temporary
    variable, read the parameter in the temp, and then set the timeout.

ros-indigo-swri-roscpp (0.0.9-3saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Adds getParam() functions to swri_roscpp.
    These functions wrap NodeHandle::getParam(). If the parameter does
    not exist, they emit an error message and return false.
  * Fixes some compiler warnings.
  * The swri::Subscriber::blockTimeouts function now returns a value.
    Previously, it did not explicitly returning a value, which has
    undefined behavior. It now returns the result of the blockTimeouts
    function that it wraps.

  * Makes swri::Subscriber's assignment operator return a value.
    According to the C++ spec, assignment operators must return a reference to the
    current object (*this). swri::Subscriber's assignment operator was not
    returning a value, which works in GCC, but not Clang. GCC would do the right
    thing for you, but Clang will compile the code but generate a SIGILL
    exception at runtime. This is easily fixed by manually returning *this.
