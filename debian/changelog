ros-indigo-swri-rospy (0.0.10-3saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Adds swri_rospy subclasses for Subscriber, Service, and Timer
    These classes are drop-in replacements for their rospy counterparts,
    except that their constructor has an additional parameter
    asynchronous, which defaults to False. If asynchronous is false, the
    callback is wrapped with the single_threaded decorator. (This means
    that all of these classes use the single-thread callback queue by
    default.)
    Also, swri_rospy.spin is now injected into the rospy namespace to
    override rospy.spin. This is done to prevent users from accidentally
    using rospy.spin, which does not process the callback queue.
  * Adds deadlock protection to single_threaded decorator.
    Decorating a function with single_threaded more than once would cause the
    callback queue to deadlock. This prevents recursive decoration.
  * Adds exception handling to single_threaded decorator.
  * Makes single_threaded decorator work for arbitrary ags
  * Adds service_wrapper decorator.
    Also fixes line endings.
  * Updates swri_rospy single_threaded example.
    Also fixes line-endings.
  * Creates a new package swri_rospy.
    swri_rospy adds a new callback-based subscription, timer, and service
    capability to rospy.
