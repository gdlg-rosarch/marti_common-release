ros-indigo-swri-nodelet (0.0.14-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Include boost/make_shared.hpp
    This header is necessary in the unlikely event that the using cpp file hasn't included boost/make_shared.hpp anywhere else. Also, it's good practice to include what you use.
  * Fix include_directories order in swri_roscpp
    Include package-local header files before catkin header files
    so that source is always built against source header files, even
    if the same package exists elsewhere in the catkin tree.

ros-indigo-swri-nodelet (0.0.13-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Add C++ and CMake macros for wrapper nodes
    Defines a C++ macro to replace the normal nodelet export wrapper that
    also creates a factory function returning a pointer to that nodelet.
    Defines a CMake macro
    swri_nodelet_add_node(NODELET_NODENAME NODELET_NAMESPACE NODELET_CLASS)
    that automatically generates the c++ code for a node wrapper with node
    name NODELET_NODENAME that wraps the nodelet and makes a CMake target
    to build the node.
  * Add tests for swri_nodelet with manager and standalone
