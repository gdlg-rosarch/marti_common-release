ros-indigo-swri-roscpp (0.0.8-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Makes swri::Subscriber's assignment operator return a value.
    According to the C++ spec, assignment operators must return a reference to the
    current object (*this). swri::Subscriber's assignment operator was not
    returning a value, which works in GCC, but not Clang. GCC would do the right
    thing for you, but Clang will compile the code but generate a SIGILL
    exception at runtime. This is easily fixed by manually returning *this.
