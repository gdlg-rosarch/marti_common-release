  * Fix distances in routeDistances for points before start point.
    There were two bugs in routeDistances that were causing the incorrect
    distance to be calculated for points before the start point.  An error
    in the iteration bounds was causing the distance of the first point to
    be 0.0.  Secondly, the arc length for the other points was just the
    relative distance between two points instead of the cummulative
    distance.
  * Merge pull request #330 <https://github.com/evenator/marti_common/issues/330> from elliotjo/sru-add-distance-functions-indigo
    Add util functions to calculate distances between route points. (indigo)
  * Remove commented out code in swri_route_util.
  * Add util functions to calculate distances between route points.
    This commit adds two utility functions to calculate the distances (in
    terms of arc length) between route points.  One function calculates
    the distance between two points, the other calculates the distance
    between one point and many other points and should provide much better
    performance for that common need.
  * Add native-ish ROS serialization support to sru::Route.
    This commit adds native(-ish) ROS serialization support so that
    swri_route_util::Route can be used directly with publishers and
    subscribers. This is purely for convenience rather than performance
    (although you will get improved performance in nodelets that
    publish/subscribe by avoiding serialization).  Under the hood, the
    implementation does serialization with the native type and then
    converts it to/from the swri_route_util::Route type.
    This commit also fixes a missing special case in
    interpolateRouteSegment (0 < distance < 1) and reorganized the if/else
    blocks to be clearer.
  * Add swri_route_util package.
    This commit adds a new package called swri_route_util that provides a
    more user-friendly interface to the marti_nav_msgs Route and RoutPoint
    classes, and a set of useful utilities.  At this point, most of the
    code (except the properties) has been well tested on bag files.
