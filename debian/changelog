ros-kinetic-swri-geometry-util (0.2.0-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Update FindGEOS to generate linker flags correctly in Ubuntu 16.04 (#348 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/marti_common/issues/348>).
    The regexes to find the link directory and library name from the
    output of geos-config were too liberal, so the library name
    regex would match on the -linux portion of the link directory,
    resulting in broken linker flags. This tightens up those regexes
    a bit to yield the correct library directory and name.
  * Fix a typedef conflict in Ubuntu 16.04 (#347 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/marti_common/issues/347>)
    Wrapping geos includes in #define statements forces geos to typedef
    int64 to int64_t so that it matches opencv's typedef.
  * Add cubic spline interface for tf::Vector3 type.

  * Fixing Jade compilation issues
    1. For some reason, Eigen3 wasn't being properly detected by CMake.  I
    added a few lines that will make it try using PkgConfig if CMake
    fails.
    2. swri_image_util's geometry_util.test was being installed but should
    not have been; nothing else is in its "launch" directory, so I removed
    the whole directory from the install.
  * Fixed compile error when ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed (#307 <https://github.com/evenator/marti_common/issues/307>)
    * Fixed compile error when package ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed.
    swri_geometry_util uses wrong version of OpenCV when the package
    ros-indigo-opencv3 is installed. This patch fixes the issue.
    * Updated all CMakeFiles.txt to specify OpenCV version 2
    The find_package for OpenCV is now:
    ./swri_opencv_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_geometry_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    ./swri_image_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2)
    ./swri_transform_util/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)
    Conflicts:
    swri_geometry_util/CMakeLists.txt
